    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p> The adult forgets the troubles of his youth. Comparing the remembered carefree past with his immediate problems, the mature man thinks that troubles belong only to the present. The twelve year-old, the adult thinks, does not worry about salary or professional advancement. When the roof leaks, only the parent worries about what contractor to employ or about how he will repair it himself. To the adult, then, childhood is a time of freedom. The child, however, wishes always to be a man. He finds freedom in the future. To him, adulthood is a time of wealth, and his father or mother never needs to worry about saving to buy a bicycle.
      Anyone who writes down to children is simply wasting his time. They are the most attentive, curious, eager, sensitive and quick readers. They accept, almost without question, anything you present them with, as long as it is presented honestly and clearly. Some writers for children deliberately avoid using words they think a child doesn't know. This ruins the prose and bores children. I throw them hard words, and they backhand them over the net. They love words that give them a hard time, provided they are in a context that absorbs their attention.</p>
